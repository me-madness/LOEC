text = """Once upon a time, there was a beautiful castle in a faraway land.
The castle was surrounded by a dense forest where magical creatures lived.
Every day, the king and queen would stroll in the castle gardens.

One day, a brave knight arrived at the castle gates seeking a quest.
He met the wise wizard who told him about a dangerous dragon that terrorized the kingdom.
The knight decided to embark on a journey to defeat the dragon and save the kingdom.

After many days of searching, the knight found the dragon's lair.
With his mighty sword, he battled the fierce dragon, and after an epic fight, he emerged victorious.
The kingdom celebrated the knight's bravery.

From that day onwards, the brave knight was known as the Dragon Slayer, and his legend spread far and wide.
The castle and its gardens became a symbol of courage and hope for all who heard the tale.
